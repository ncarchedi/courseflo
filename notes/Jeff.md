- currently using leanpub for online courses:
  - mostly markdown, with some special formatting
  - prefers the plain text authoring
  - can download as a book
  - quizzes in vertical orientation
  - had to write their own R package to validate the markdown
    - https://github.com/jhudsl/didactr
    - leanpub validation errors are very unhelpful
- what he likes about plain text
  - programmatically generate quiz options
  - version control
  - ability to programmatically upload content
  - really doesn't like point-and-click
- biggest cons
  - user experience for learner is clunky
  - learner buys a certain number of attempts at a course
  - basically an adaptation of their books product
  - updating content (esp videos is the biggest pain point)
  - no dashboard for student-level data -> has to download
- for them, it's all about how to reduce maintenance costs
- likes TeachersPayTeachers for existing K-12 content
- for his classrooms, he mixes and matches existing and original content
- hopkins has an in-house system called course+ (an LMS)
  - sort of a "semi-requirement" but he hates it
  - some people use blackboard
  - product details
    - has different question types
    - easy to link to student dashboards
    - grade management
    - can edit his classes
- if going to host student grades, there are security requirements (FERPA)
- he says "everything is going online"
- suggestions for courseflo:
  - integration with grading systems may be useful
  - have course landing pages?
  - analytics? video views, etc.
  - he thinks the sharing part could be where the action is
    - link-based? email-based? different permission levels
  - ability to share feedback on individual questions
  - teacher has ability to view completed quizzes
    - look at one question at a time, across students
    - look at "focus and reply" view in Hey
- inspiration: look at duolingo matching and drag-and-drop questions
  - example: drag an equation into place
- how will teachers communicate with students in or around courseflo?
- how could courseflo be used in a real-time format
- he'd be willing to intro me to the course+ person
- possibilities for horizontal orientation
  - adaptive tests
  - branching logic
- features they would need to migrate the capstone
  - branching logic
  - integration with coursera grading api
- the market that feels unserved to him:
  - tons of LMS, MOOCs, etc.
  - but if he wants to do something super lightweight...
  - no feedback on it -> missing the entire return trip
  - puts the info out but doesn't get anything back
- example use case
  - a tool for getting feedback on things quickly and easily
  - idea of a microcourse
- says he would use this right now if I had...
  - high-level analytics + drill-down on individual users (existing review screen)
  - some control over access (maybe)
- **his biggest requests**
  - **analytics**
  - access control
  - branching logic
  - ability to ping other apps (e.g. cash for courses) or expose API to programmatically determine completions, scores, etc.
- look at the slack model
  - everyone gets on for free
  - but if you want to keep the history, you have to pay
  - maybe if you want to record more than 10 responses
  - "you never actually hit a paywall" -> you just pay because it's more convenient
- look at new RStudio cloud pricing model
